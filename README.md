### About me
Passionate about international development, I bring a diverse background spanning academia, 
the United Nations, and the private sector. With a Ph.D. in Global Studies and experience in international migration, 
economic development, and policy research, I specialize in qualitative and quantitative analysis, project management, and 
capacity-building initiatives.

At the United Nations ECLAC, I designed and implemented research projects advancing the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals,
focusing on socioeconomic and environmental statistics, labour markets, and migration. I also facilitated 
technical capacity-building workshops and multilateral meetings with Member State representatives. Before that, I published
peer-reviewed research on international political economy, migration, and regime stability in academia. Additionally, my 
freelance work included organizing international conferences, contributing to communications strategies for NGOs, and 
conducting field research on ecological risks and community knowledge creation.

My international experiences—having lived in Germany, the Caribbean, Venezuela, the United States, and Egypt and witnessing 
socioeconomic disparities firsthand—have shaped my commitment to global development. Fluent in five languages 
(English, German, Spanish, French, and Portuguese), I thrive in multicultural environments and bring high cultural and gender 
sensitivity to my work.
