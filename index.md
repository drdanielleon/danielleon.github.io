# Data Analysis | Statistics | International Development

## About me
Passionate about data analysis, statistics, and international development, I bring a diverse background spanning academia and the United Nations. With a Ph.D. in Global Studies, I specialize in quantitative and qualitative data analysis, international political economy, and capacity-building initiatives.

At the United Nations ECLAC, I designed and implemented research projects advancing the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, focusing on socioeconomic and environmental statistics, labour markets, and migration. I also facilitated technical capacity-building workshops and multilateral meetings with Member State representatives. Before that, I published peer-reviewed research on international political economy, migration, and regime stability in academia. Additionally, my freelance work included organizing international conferences, contributing to communications strategies for NGOs, and conducting field research on ecological risks and community knowledge creation.

My international experiences—having lived in Germany, the Caribbean, Venezuela, the United States, and Egypt and witnessing socioeconomic disparities firsthand—have shaped my commitment to global development. Fluent in English, German, and Spanish, and with good knowledge of French and Portuguese, I thrive in multicultural environments and bring high cultural and gender sensitivity to my work.

In this page, I provide vingnettes of some of my recently projects in data analysis and statistics.

### Labour productivity, education financing and education outcomes in the Caribbean

This ongoing project argues that labour productivity is an important cornerstone of the modern economy and increasing it is essential for countries to maintain economic growth, a crucial factor for achieving several sustainable development goals (SDGs), including eliminating poverty and hunger and promoting decent work (SDGs 1, 2, and 8). Unfortunately, available data show that labour productivity has declined or stagnated in most Caribbean countries in recent years. Arguably, deficiencies in the education system are a factor in the poor labour productivity of the subregion. These deficiencies, such as poor educational attainment and skills mismatch, result in poor quality of output, even as the number of school leavers and graduates increase, ultimately resulting in relatively low human capital, which hinders labour productivity in the Caribbean.

Labour productivity from 2012 to 2022 in 12 Caribbean member States was about four US$ lower than the SIDS average, as shown in figure 1. This trendline exhibits a stagnant trend at between 17 and 18 US$ from 2012 to 2019, after which it shows a steep upward slope, reaching 20.26 US$ in 2022. However, removing Guyana from the trendline of average labour productivity, containing 11 Caribbean member States, shows that this indicator stagnated throughout the analysed period at around 17 US$. Guyana is an outlier due to the massive oil windfalls accrued by this country in the late 2010s. As a result, the meteoric rise of its GDP in the recent past increases the indicator of output per hour worked, thus inflating its labour productivity levels.

#### Figure 1: Labour productivity growth

The trendline with eight Caribbean member States reveals a downward trend of labour productivity from 2012 to 2022 (Figure 1). This trendline excludes four Caribbeancountries; three countries with substantially larger populations compared to the other Caribbean countries (Cuba, Dominican Republic, and Haiti) and Guyana, an outlier due to extraordinary hydrocarbon windfalls. Average output per hour worked in these eight English- and Dutch-speaking Caribbean member States progressively fell from 19.5 US$ in 2012 to 18.9 US$ in 2019 (Figure 13). The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected labour productivity, as expected, and output per hour worked further dropped to 17.7 US$ in 2020 and 2021, before recovering to 18.5 US$ in 2022. However, average output per hour worked in 2022 was one dollar less than one decade prior.

Orthodox human capital theory places the skills and knowledge imparted by educational institutions in adults, youth and children as a key driver of human capital (Becker, 993), and thus of labour productivity. The different industrial revolutions exemplify how productivity is driven by a labour force that can innovate complex technologies and effectively work with them to increase economic growth. Hence, education in the Caribbean is vital for economic development, social mobility, and individual empowerment (Wright, 2024). Although education is central to human capital formation, and thus to sustainable economic development, public financing for education in the Caribbean is not always optimal, creating deficiencies in educational outcomes. These deficiencies contribute to mismatches between educational outcomes and labour market needs, which adversely affect economic productivity in the subregion.
   
Educational outcomes are directly related to measures of sustainable development, such as labour productivity. Not surprisingly, the Human Development Index shows high correlation with the learning-adjusted years of school (average years of school weighted for the average harmonized test scores) for 25 SIDS, including 11 Caribbean member States for 2020 (Figure 2). This correlation is statistically significant (P-value < 0.001) and positive (R2 = 0.85), suggesting a strong relationship between education and human development. Yet, students in the subregion face significant challenges that hinder human capital formation and threaten progress on Goal 4 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which aims for inclusive and equitable quality education for all.

The impact of education onlabour productivity in the Caribbean is profound. Due to the importance of education as a key driver of human capital, public investments in education are essential to equip the workforce with the necessary skills, allowing them to contribute to overall productivity through their labour (Becker, 1993). This relationship is depicted in Figure 3, which correlates the average learning-adjusted years of school and government expenditure on education as a proportion of GDP, scaled for the population under 18 years of age in 25 SIDS for 2020. This correlation shows a moderately positively (R2 of 0.49) and statistically significant (P-value < 0.05) relationship between these variables. This relationship suggests that adequate public investments in education are essential for human capital accumulation.

### How natural resource exports moderate business cycles’ relationship to high homicide rates

In a research article published in 2023 in the journal Global Crime, I explore the relationships between macroeconomic conditions and how the forms of integration into the global economy affect homicide rates in 21 high-violence countries from 2000 to 2018. The analysis focuses on countries integrated into the global economy by accruing international economic rents. I use data from 2000 to 2018 to analyze how resource rents and remittances moderated the relationship between business cycles and high homicide rates. In this vignette, however, I focus solely resource rents, meaning exceedingly high income accrued by governments from natural resource exports. The results indicate that natural resource rents conditioned a procyclical relationship between business cycles and homicide rates. The findings contribute to the rich and growing economic criminology and international political economy literature investigating how international rents condition subnational violence. 

#### Table 1: The mediated moderation model of homicide rates by resource rents

Table 1 shows the results of the moderated mediation model with resource rents as the conditioning variable. Model 1 depicts an overall moderating effect, as the interaction term between the predictor and moderating variable are statistically significant and exhibit the expected positive sign. Notably, GDP growth per capita is negative and statistically significant, thus showing a countercyclical relationship to homicide rates, as theoretically expected. Furthermore, Model 2 shows a statistically significant relationship between the predictor and the outcome variable. Hence, the first two models’ results confirm the statistical assumptions to estimate the complete moderated mediation model depicted in Model 3. The entire model’s results show that the mediating variable is statistically significant and positive. Importantly, these results meet the theoretical expectation that the overall process passes through the misery index, even if the interaction term between the moderator and mediator was statistically insignificant. Model 3 also shows that the effect size of the predictor variable decreased from approximately -1.71 to -1.47, further indicating that the moderated mediation effect is partial but present. Crucially, the interaction term between the predictor and moderating variable remains significant and positive in model 3. Hence, there is evidence that resource rents procyclically moderated the indirect effect between business cycles and homicide rates.

#### Figure 4: Marginal effect of resource rents on GDP growth per capita

Illustrating the interaction term between GDP growth per capita and resource rents, estimated in Model 3, helps interpret the results properly (Berry et al., 2012). Figure 4 shows that a unit increase in resource rents or yearly GDP per capita reverses the countercyclical relationship between business cycles and homicide rates. In other words, marginal increases in resource rents interact to make the relationship between business cycles and homicide rates procyclical. The 95 percent confidence interval of the left-hand plot departs from zero, except in the higher levels of rent accruement due to resource rent’s low number of observations at its higher values. However, the right-hand plot’s 95 percent confidence interval does not depart from zero after the minus five value of GDP growth per capita, likely due to the low number of observations.

The results of resource rents’ moderating effect provide sufficient evidence to partially confirm the first hypothesis and reject this paper’s second hypothesis. The confirmation of the first hypothesis is only partial because the confidence intervals of the plots in Figure 1 do not entirely depart from zero. However, the plots show steep upward slopes, suggesting that one-unit marginal increases in the interaction between the predictor and moderator variables lead to one- to two-point increases in the outcome variable of homicide rates. In other words, these results suggest but do not fully confirm a procyclical moderation effect by direct international rents on the studied countries’ business cycles, which leads to increased homicide rates.
